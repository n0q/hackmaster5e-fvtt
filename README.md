# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Some rough edges here and there, but this should do what you need. May all your hits be crits!

Don't worry if updates are slow or sluggish. I work on this project as time allows.

## Roadmap

##### 0.5: Cleanup, Refactors, and Restyles

##### 1.0: Combat Revamp

Better support for melee, ranged, and magical combat. This includes (but is not limited to) fighting styles (and two weapon fighting), grappling, improved ranged combat all around, and spell volatility.

##### 1.1: Magic and Weapon Effects

Automatic tracking and handling of spell effects, poisons, and damage types.
