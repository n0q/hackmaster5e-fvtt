# hackmaster5e-fvtt

Hackmaster for Foundry. Some rough edges here and there, but this should do what you need. May all your hits be crits!

----
## Roadmap
##### 0.4: Combat Revamp
Better support for melee, ranged, and magical combat. This includes (but is not limited to) fighting styles (and two weapon fighting), grappling, improved ranged combat all around, and spell volatility.

##### 0.5: Magic and Weapon Effects
Automatic tracking and handling of spell effects, poisons, and damage types.
